## Code for Ethnicity Prediction
Preferably use Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle Kernels or Google Collab.

### code1) ML_Project_Ethnicity.ipynb :
                This code has both Ethnicity Train and Prediction model.
                How to run the code-
                Use any jupyter notebook base .ipynb file environment like google collab or kaggle Kernel.
                jupyter notebook is strongly recommanded.
                Install all the libraries and dependencies for running the notebook.
                Then , run the code cell by cell.
                
                Different Functions are build for prediction.
                    1. Function Prediction() takes an RGB image as parameter and predicts the ethnicity.
                    2. Function Capture_from_webcam() opens your web camera if available and then captures and returns an image by pressing 'C'.
                              note:- The captured image should have face data in maximum area possible for best results.
                    3. Function predict_from_dataset() takes index of image in CSV file as input and predicts and returns the predicted value.
